# Imgur Album Downloader
It is extremely experimental and is my first project in GO. 

Here is an example on how to use this:
```go
go run imgur-downloader.go https://imgur.com/gallery/vgW1p dogs
```
The first argument is the URL and the second argument is the directory that will be created to place the images.
